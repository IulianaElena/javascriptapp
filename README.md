Design / Architecture considerations

Which browsers should be supported?

Assumption: The latest browsers.

How should the application manage its state?

React component state /Redux.

Haven't used webpack before, thus it has returned some errors. Given the code, I am not sure it can be launched. I have tried to create a React app instead of the webpack, but due to some errors to which I haven't found any helpful solution via internet, the build has failed.
